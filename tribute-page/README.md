## Overview

### The challenge

Fullfill the below user stories:

- User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
- User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
- User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
- User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
- User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
- User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
- User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
- User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
- User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.

## My Process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Media_objects) - This helped me with better undestanding the use of media queries.

- [DevDocs.io](https://devdocs.io/css/) - This is a very useful documentation site which I used to review specific CSS syntax. Highly recommended!
